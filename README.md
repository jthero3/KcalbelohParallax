# Kcalbeloh-ParallaxContinued

This mod adds Parallax Continued Support to Jason Kerman's amazing [Kcalbeloh Mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/203753-1125-kcalbeloh-system-planet-pack-v118-a-journey-to-a-black-hole-aug-31-2024/). These configs are based on upgraded versions from the original pack. Apart from Scaled Space, most of the configs are based entirely on them. Future work is planned on adding, and/or changing scatters, and custom terrain textures.
